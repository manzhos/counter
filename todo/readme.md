For the Home assignment please create a project which include FE and BE sides:
For the BE use NODE.JS and Mongo DB
For the Client side use React
Client:
A simple screen with a title and 2 buttons:
1. Reset counter
2. Inc counter +1
3. Dec counter -1
Server Side:
CRUD API which writes to the DB
Some rolls:
1. Once user press a button there will be DB update action. In case the entry doesnâ€™t exist the action will create it.
2. Each tab creates a different session.
3. For each session need to write to the DB : CreatedAt, Last update, Counter, sessionID.
4. The design should assume thousands of sessions.
Once you have it ready push it to Git and send me the link.
If you can create an Azure/AWS account and run the servers there it would be the best.
